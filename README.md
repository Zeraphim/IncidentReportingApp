# AGAP: AGAP: Incident Reporting Web Application

## 💡 What is AGAP?💡

AGAP is an Incident Reporting Web Application that aims to give real-time information to the public regarding the relevant incidents such as crime, accidents, missing persons, and hazards within Metro Manila, Philippines using a crowdsourced “social media” approach and by showing the incident reports in different cities. This application offers fast and reliable sources of information about the relevant events in our country, and it ensures that all the incident reports posted in the application are trustworthy by implementing a reputation system for incident reports. Moreover, the application enables people to use the web application to broadcast pictures and videos from any event including crime, accidents, missing persons, or hazards. AGAP’s objective is to achieve openness and transparency in the community that empowers everyone from the city council to residents. This platform encourages people to use their devices to protect others and to prevent a tragedy. By developing this kind of web application, we can make plausible efforts to trace, share and report incidents and situations as quickly as possible, which will benefit local citizens to a safer environment to protect their well-being and safety.
